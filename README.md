# MSXX
My attempt in creating a MSX, naming it a MSX X, the MSX 10, or just MSX-X. say X two times.
Who cares about the name, I dont have any software or pcb layouts here yet. But the idea is here.

## Idea
* A set of pcb options based on 1 or more schematic options to get or generate a board suitable for the user.
posibly 1 protoype to start on, and I dont want to be too ambitious. basicly a Z80 board thats MSX capable if populated enough.

* Software monitor, hexeditor, and basic. official MSX rom's would be awesome, well see what we need

* expansion slots, 2 minimal supported. 

* GPU, when chosen, as fast and powerfull posible, MSX2 style a V9958. due to its not being manufactured anymore.. maybe a FPGA implementation option later. (would be cool if someone makes a Asic of the 9958 or later).

* CPU, I prever a Zilog Z80 family cpu over fpga or software implementations.

* ram, ram is cheap these days, should be the max the cpu can handle. due to point 1, options are welcome.


## What its not

It should not be a emulator. an emultor written to replicate this design is fine but we are not gonna put a SoC or cpu capable of emulating the complete MSX in its internals. option to use the design as a expansion board is posible, but not the main focus.
